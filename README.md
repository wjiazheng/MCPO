Unsupervised MRI-US Multimodal Image Registration with Multilevel Correlation Pyramidal Optimization (team next-gen-nn)

which won the fist place for [ReMIND2Reg Learn2Reg MICCAI 2025](https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/)

Method description: update soon

The method is based on [ConvexAdam](https://github.com/multimodallearning/convexAdam) and [MCBO](https://github.com/wjiazheng/MCBO)

Before running the code 'MCPO_p4_6543.py', please modify ‘datasets_path’ and ‘result_path’ in the args.

When using different modalities and datasets, remember to adjust ‘fixed_mod’ and ‘moving_mod’.
